# Gamification Robot

This project is for a presentation in the "Gamification and Game Studies" course at Beijing Normal University, where we use the "gamification robot" to analyze gamified works.

Note: For the best experience, the terminal window size should not be less than 136x40.

## The Avatar of the Gamification Robot

I use BMO here as the avatar of the gamification robot because I really love BMO (and Adventure Time)!!ðŸ¥° Besides, BMO is a robot who can run games on himself, which sort of fits in with the theme of gamification robotsðŸ˜œ

The source of BMO picture we use can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/wj5z5c/bmo/). Also, we use the [ASCII-generator](https://github.com/vietnh1009/ASCII-generator) to generate the ASCII text picture of BMO. Many thanks!
